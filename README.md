## README for `bus_dev_hw5` Repository

### Overview

This repository contains Python code to solve the waterfall distribution problems as outlined in Assignment #5 for the Business of Development course at Columbia University. The assignment focuses on calculating developer and equity partner profits based on specified terms and internal rate of return (IRR) hurdles.

### Files in the Repository

- `hw5_2.aux`: Auxiliary file generated by LaTeX.
- `hw5_2.log`: Log file generated by LaTeX.
- `hw5_2.pdf`: PDF file of the LaTeX write-up.
- `hw5_2.py`: Python script for initial calculations.
- `hw5_2.tex`: LaTeX source file for the write-up.
- `hw5_2_df.py`: Enhanced Python script using pandas DataFrame for better formatting and display.
- `promote_and_split.py`: Python script to calculate promote and split distributions.

### Instructions to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bus_dev_hw5.git
   cd bus_dev_hw5
   ```

2. **Run the Python Script:**
   Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher). You will also need to install the required packages if not already available.
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas numpy-financial
   ```

   To run the main script:
   ```sh
   python hw5_2_df.py
   ```

3. **View the Results:**
   The script will print out the results in a formatted table showing the calculations and intermediate results for both the developer and the uncle.

### Description of the Code

The main script, `hw5_2_df.py`, performs the following calculations:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Defines the Total Development Cost (TDC), Sell Price (SP), target IRR, and the equity shares for the developer and the uncle.

2. **Calculates Required Returns:**
   - Uses a goal-seek function to determine the uncle's required return to meet a 15% IRR.

3. **Calculates Remaining Profits:**
   - Determines the remaining profit after the uncle's required return is subtracted from the sell price.

4. **Distributes Profits:**
   - Calculates the developer's and the uncle's profits based on their respective equity shares and promote structures.

5. **Formats and Displays Results:**
   - Uses pandas DataFrame to format the results into a readable table.

### Results

For Question 1a, assuming an all-equity deal with a $10mm TDC and selling the project for $20mm after 2 years:
- **Developer's Profit:** \$2,032,500
- **Uncle's Profit:** \$4,742,500

For Question 1b, the minimum sell price to ensure the developer does not work for free is \$18,892,857.14, resulting in a minimum profit for the developer of \$8,892,857.14.

For Question 2, with 50% debt financing, TDC increasing to $11mm, and selling the project for $20mm after 2 years:
- **Developer's Profit:** \$4,514,250
- **Uncle's Profit:** \$4,167,000
- **Promote:** \$3,472,500

The better deal for the developer, based on the calculations, is Deal 2 (50% Debt Financing).

### Applying the Code to Other Projects

To adapt the provided code for other similar projects, you can modify the following parameters:
- **Total Development Cost (TDC):** The overall cost of the development project.
- **Sell Price (SP):** The anticipated or actual selling price of the project.
- **Target IRR:** The desired internal rate of return for the equity partner.
- **Equity Shares:** The percentage of equity held by the developer and the partner.

Adjust these values according to your specific project requirements and rerun the script to obtain the new distribution results.
